# WorkoutTracker
The project is to develop a website that tracks daily workouts. A person will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress. The user has the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout. Also, the user can choose to add exercises to a previous workout plan or to add new exercises to a new workout plan.
The website creation required the creation of a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## Motivation
This project is homework17 from UT Coding Bootcamp.

### Prerequisites
The software will run in any webpage.
